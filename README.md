Pardinus
=======

Pardinus is Kodkod's (slightly bulkier) Iberian cousin. 

<a href="https://travis-ci.com/haslab/Pardinus"><img align="right" alt="Build Status" src="https://travis-ci.com/haslab/Pardinus.svg?branch=master"/></a>

This repository includes the source code for the Pardinus solver, an extension to the [Kodkod](http://alloy.mit.edu/kodkod/index.html) solver for relational logic. It extends Kodkod with the following functionalities:
* Target-oriented and weighted-target oriented model finding
* Model finding over (past and future) LTL relational formulas
* Symbolic bound declarations
* Decomposed parallelized model finding
* Unbounded relational model finding

Pardinus is developed at the High-Assurance Software Laboratory ([pardinus](http://haslab.di.uminho.pt)), from INESC TEC and University of Minho, and is led by Alcino Cunha and Nuno Macedo. It is used as a back-end for [Electrum Analyzer](https://github.com/haslab/Electrum), which is itself an extension to the Alloy Analyzer.

Pardinus is open-source and available under the [MIT license](LICENSE), as is Kodkod. However, the implementation relies on third-party solvers ([SAT4J](http://www.sat4j.org), [MiniSat](http://minisat.se), [Glucose/Syrup](http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/), [(P)Lingeling](http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/), [Yices](http://yices.csl.sri.com), and [Electrod](https://github.com/grayswandyr/electrod/)), some of which are released under stricter licenses (see the various LICENSE files in the distribution for details).

## Building Pardinus

Pardinus inherits [Kodkod](https://github.com/emina/kodkod/blob/master/README.md#building-and-installing-kodkod)'s 
building and running instructions.

Kodkod uses the [Waf](https://github.com/waf-project/waf) build
system, which requires Python 2.5 or later. You will also need Java 8
and a C/C++ compiler, and your JAVA_HOME environment variable needs to
point to the JDK 8 home directory.

* Set the JAVA_HOME variable. For example, on OS X:

  ``$ export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home` ``

* Clone the Pardinus repository:

  `$ git clone https://github.com/haslab/Pardinus.git`  
  `$ cd Pardinus`  

* Download Waf 1.8.12 and make it executable:

  `$ wget --no-check-certificate https://waf.io/waf-1.8.12`  
  `$ chmod u+x waf-1.8.12`   
  `$ alias waf=$PWD/waf-1.8.12`

* Build the native libraries, ``pardinus.jar``, and ``examples.jar`` and install them into the ``pardinus/lib`` directory:

  `$ waf configure --prefix=. --libdir=lib build install`
